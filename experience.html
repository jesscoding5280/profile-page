                <p>I have held several positions since entering the workforce. I've ranged from being a sales woman on the floors of some of the busiest companies to running multi-million dollar contacts.</p>
                <p>Every job is important and every job is worth doing well.</p>
                <p>I've enjoyed my time in these various roles. Thanks to my experience from these jobs I feel incredibly ready and prepared for the next step in my life.</p>

                <p>In my spare time I love to learn. That sounds wrong, right?</p>
                <p>I'm an avid self-studier. From things like languages to sewing, I'm always trying to teach myself something new.</p>
                <p>Some more things that I enjoy are the outdoors, but I don't get out nearly enough!</p>
                <p>I'm also a huge fan of baking.</p>
                <p>That's just a couple random things about me. I hope to tell you <i>more</i> soon!</p>

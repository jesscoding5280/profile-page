                    </ul>
                    <p>I have held several positions since entering the workforce. I've been a part of the sales team for one of the busiest companies in the world to running multi-million dollar contacts on behalf of the government.</p>
                    <p>I've enjoyed my time in these various roles. Thanks to my experience from these jobs I feel incredibly ready and prepared for the next step in my life.</p>                
                    <p>If I could offer a reminder to anyone in a similar career transition, it would be this:</p>
                    <p>Every job is important and every job is worth doing well.</p>

                <p>In my spare time I love to learn. That sounds wrong, right?</p>
                <p>I'm an avid self-studier. From things like languages to sewing, I'm always trying to teach myself something new.</p>
                <p>Some more things that I enjoy are the outdoors, but I don't get out nearly enough!</p>
                <p>I'm also a huge fan of baking.</p>
                <p>That's just a couple random things about me. I hope to tell you <i>more</i> soon!</p>
